#summary List of items to be done on this project

Next to be implemented (add information here):
 * consider refactoring the model, so it does not include constants and natural numbers, they should be treted as regular applications, but move their creation to the calculus facade
 * finish decoupling of parser and printing from tests and from implementation (add mocking support for Calculus facade)
 * refactor beta-reduction and normalization to Visitor
 * implement printing to syntax with de Bruijn indexes using Visitor
 * finish alpha equivalence (add unit tests)
 * implement eta reduction for convenient use of recursion
 * extract the traversal strategy from visitors
 * pay technical debt
